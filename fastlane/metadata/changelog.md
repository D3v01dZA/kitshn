Hey ‚úåÔ∏è
I decided to release **kitshn v1.0.0** ‚Äî this will be the **final release** compatible with *
*Tandoor v1** ü•≥
I will now focus on working on compatibility with **Tandoor v2** because there have been some API
and
functionality changes.

I'll consider releasing beta builds on **GitHub**, **Google Play** and **TestFlight** when the main
migrations have been done! :)

This week's release just contains some small new features and minor improvements:

1. Implemented support to **select sharing users** in **meal plan** creation/ edit dialog (#148).
2. Implemented support to **select sharing users** in **recipe book** creation/ edit dialog (#154).
3. Added check to **prevent empty steps** when **importing recipes** (#157).
4. Checked **compatibility** with Tandoor **version 1.5.34**.
