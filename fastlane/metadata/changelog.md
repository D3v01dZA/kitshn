Hey ‚úåÔ∏è
This is the third version of kitshn **compatible** with the API changes for *
*[Tandoor v2](https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha-2)**. ü•≥
New versions of kitshn will **no longer** support instances on **v1.5.***.

This beta is available here on **GitHub**, through **[Google Play testing](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/de.kitshn.android)** and through **[TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/zx1xzSMg)**.

Although I have tested the app with **Tandoor v2.0.0-alpha-2**, there could still be some minor API
changes that I might have missed, so **please feel free** to comment on #95 or create **a new issue** if you **encounter any issues**! :)

---

1. Added support for **AI import**, a **new** feature of **Tandoor v2
   ** ([learn more](https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/blob/feature/vue3/docs/system/configuration.md#ai-integration)) (
   #95).
2. Implemented button to **clear shopping list** from **all** or **done** entries (#95).
3. Added **recipe name** to **sharing text** for easier identification (#185).
4. Enabled users to **disable** the **shopping mode enlargement** (#181).
5. Checked **compatibility** with Tandoor **version 2.0.0-alpha-2**.
