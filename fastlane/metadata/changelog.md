Hey ‚úåÔ∏è
This is the second version of kitshn **compatible** with the API changes for **[Tandoor v2](https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha-1)**. ü•≥
New versions of kitshn will **no longer** support instances on **v1.5.***.

This beta is available here on **GitHub**, through **[Google Play testing](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/de.kitshn.android)** and through **[TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/zx1xzSMg)**.

Although I have tested the app with **Tandoor v2.0.0-alpha-1**, there could still be some minor API
changes that I might have missed, so **please feel free** to comment on #95 or create **a new issue** if you **encounter any issues**! :)
